---Using Sentiment Analysis to evaluate "Social Sensitivity" towards wildfires--- 

Project outline: 

1. Retrieve tweets on wildfires using the twitter stream 

2. Assign sentiment to tweets 

3. Use those tweets to train a classifier using a support vector machine algorithm

4. Now gather tweets on two or more different wildfire incidents to be evaluated using a stream 

5. Perform sentiment analysis on seperate data sets 

6. Using the results, compare the overall reaction/attention to the individual wildfires

7. Using geotagging, consider location with other attributes in comparison
  - location to evaluate regional factors 
  - severity
  - duration
  - population of affected area
  
7. Track/present the results using data visualization tools to display findings 
  - tablo vs d3.js
  
  
  
 STRETCH GOAL: Compare the results of sentiment analysis using different SVM algorithms
