---Using Sentiment Analysis to evaluate "Social Sensitivity" towards wildfires--- 

Project outline: 
1. Retrieve tweets on wildfires using the twitter stream 
2. Assign sentiment to tweets 
3. Use those tweets to train a classifier using a support vector machine algorithm
4. Now gather tweets to be evaluated using a stream, but gather from two different locations 
  - Retrieve tweets from specific locations using geotagging 
5. Perform sentiment analysis on seperate data sets 
6. Using the results, compare the overall reaction/attention to wildfires in location with other attributes of the wildfires
  - severity
  - duration
  - population of affected area
7. Track the results using data visualization tools to display findings 
  - tablo vs d3.js
